# Introduction to the Auth0 Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) Playground

<DocumentationNotice />

## What is Auth0 FGA Playground?

The [Auth0 FGA Playground](https://play.fga.dev/) is a learning tool meant to help you learn and play with <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>. It allows you to easily create, visualize, share and test your authorization models.

:::caution Warning
Currently on the Playground, store security is through obscurity; to access a store you need to know its UUID, but there are no other checks. Please use identifiers and do not store any PII or data that cannot be public.

### Default Stores vs. User Stores

The Auth0 FGA Playground has both **default stores** and **user stores**.

**Default stores** have authorization models, relationship tuples and assertions that are pre-populated by Auth0 and are not modifiable. They are samples to allow you to better understand advanced use cases.

**User stores** are user defined configurations. The authorization models, relationship tuples and assertions may be modified and saved.

## Creating a new store

1. Click the **NEW STORE** button on the top right hand corner of the screen.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground New Store button](./assets/playground-new-store-1.svg)

2. Type in store name in the text box. Note that the store name may only contain letters, numbers and '-'.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground new store prompt](./assets/playground-new-store-2.svg)

3. Click the **CREATE** button.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground new store create button](./assets/playground-new-store-3.svg)

## Saving your model

1. On your **User Stores**, you may make changes to the <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> in the types panel located on the upper left part of the screen. Note that only the [DSL syntax](../modeling/configuration-language.mdx#where-is-it-used-and-what-is-it-used-for) is supported.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground types panel](./assets/playground-update-model-1.svg)

2. After the changes are made, click **SAVE**.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground types save button](./assets/playground-update-model-2.svg)

3. After the authorization model is saved, the _Types Previewer_ will be updated with the new authorization model preview.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground type preview](./assets/playground-update-model-3.svg)

4. After the authorization model is saved, the **SAVE** button is no longer active.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground type save button after save](./assets/playground-update-model-4.svg)

   :::info

   - Playground will only save if there are no syntax errors.
   :::

   :::info
   Syntax errors will be highlighted in red. Hovering the mouse over the error will provide additional details.

## Adding relationship tuples

1. On your **User Stores**, you may add <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" /> in the relationship tuples panel located on the lower left part of the screen.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground relationship tuples panel](./assets/playground-tuple_panel.svg)

2. Click the **ADD TUPLE** button to add new relationship tuples.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground add tuples button](./assets/playground-add-tuple-1.svg)

3. This will bring up the text boxes for User, Relation and Object. Type in the desired values.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground add tuples screen](./assets/playground-add-tuple-2.svg)

4. Click the **SAVE** button.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground add tuples save button](./assets/playground-add-tuple-3.svg)

5. The added relationship tuples will be shown in the relationship tuples panel.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground relationship tuples added](./assets/playground-add-tuple-4.svg)

6. Relationship tuples may be removed by clicking the garbage bin button.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground relationship tuples removal button](./assets/playground-remove-tuple-1.svg)

   :::info
   Relationship tuples may not be added if the corresponding authentication model has not yet been saved/updated. This can be verified by having an _active_ **SAVE** button in the types panel.
   :::

## Adding assertions

1. On your **User Stores**, you may run assertions to test authorization models and relationship tuples. To add new assertions, click the _Assertions_ tab in the relationship tuples panel located on the lower left part of the screen.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertions tab](./assets/playground-assertion-panel-1.svg)

2. After Assertions tab is selected, click **ADD ASSERTION** to add new assertions.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground add assertion button](./assets/playground-assertion-panel-2.svg)

3. This will bring up the text for User, Relation and Object. Type in the values desired. The **Allowed** selection is _TRUE_ if you want to assert the relationship exists. Otherwise, **Allowed** selection is _FALSE_ if you want to assert the relationship does not exist.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertion true relationship](./assets/playground-assertion-text-2.svg)

4. Click the **SAVE** button to add the assertion.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertion being saved](./assets/playground-assertion-text-3.svg)

5. Assert for non-existing relationship by selected **Allowed** to be _FALSE_.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertion false relationship](./assets/playground-assertion-text-4.svg)

6. To run all tests, click the **Run all tests** button.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertion run all tests button](./assets/playground-assertion-run-all-tests-1.svg)

7. The assertion test results are indicated in the assertion panels. The _blue experiment box_ shows the number of tests. The _green check box_ indicates the number of passing assertions. The _red slash box_ indicates the number of failed assertions.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground assertion results](./assets/playground-assertion-test-resultsa.svg)

## Running queries

1. You may also run relationship tuple queries to view how the relationship is established between a user and an object. To do this, click the _TUPLE QUERIES_ tab in the previewer panel at the lower right half of the screen.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground queries tab](./assets/playground-query-panel-1.svg)

2. After _TUPLE QUERIES_ tab is clicked, you will be shown the _TUPLE QUERIES_ panel where you can type the query at the text box.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground query text box](./assets/playground-query-panel-2.svg)

There are two types of queries that can be asked:

### Is x related to y as z?

The first type of query is of the form: "Is x related to y as z?". This form of query will provide visualization on why the relationship exists between user and object.

1. In the query box, type "Is adam related to resource:page1 as reader?" and hit _Enter_.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground is related query](./assets/playground-query-assertion-how-1.svg)

2. A successful query will show visualization on how the relationship is established in the **TUPLE QUERIES** panel.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground successful how query](./assets/playground-query-assertion-how-2.svg)

3. An unsuccessful query will be denoted with a red box in the **TUPLE QUERIES** panel.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground unsuccessful query](./assets/playground-query-assertion-bad-how.svg)

### Who is related to y as z?

The second type of query is of the form: "Who is related to y as z?". This form of query will provide visualization on who has a particular relationship with an object.

1. In the query box, type "who is to related to resource:page1 as reader?" and hit _Enter_.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground who is related query](./assets/playground-query-assertion-who-1.svg)

2. A successful query will show visualization on all the users that have the relationship in the **TUPLE QUERIES** panel. As it can be seen, only adam has reader relationship with resource:page1.
   ![Image showing the Auth0 FGA Playground successful who query](./assets/playground-query-assertion-who-2.svg)
